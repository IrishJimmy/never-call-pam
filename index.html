  <h2>Never Trust PAM!  Here is my True Story</h2>
  <!-- (Table remains unchanged) -->
  
  <div class="blog-post">
    <h2>üì¢ "Trust the Process?" ‚Äî How PAM Failed Me at Every Step</h2>
    <p><strong>By Jim Ward | July 2025</strong></p>

    <p>When a pipe burst in my ceiling in January 2024 and flooded my home, I thought the worst was over. I was wrong.</p>

    <p>That disaster marked the start of a <strong>year-and-a-half nightmare</strong>‚Äînot because of the water damage, but because of the company I hired to help me recover: <strong>Public Adjusters of Michigan (PAM)</strong>.</p>

    <p>They promised to be my advocates. Instead, they <strong>delayed, miscommunicated, dodged responsibility, and nearly bankrupted me</strong> while I fought to get my home‚Äîand my life‚Äîback.</p>

    <h3>üö® Red Flags from the Start</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PAM failed to act quickly</strong> after the flood, allowing moisture to linger and damage to spread.</li>
      <li>Their "mitigation" was a joke‚Äîinsulation was left hanging, soaked drywall ignored, and they brushed off my concerns.</li>
      <li>I asked questions. I pushed for updates. But PAM gave me <strong>radio silence for weeks</strong>‚Äîand eventually months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üßæ Doing Their Job <em>For</em> Them</h3>
    <p>I paid PAM <strong>10% of my entire claim</strong> so I wouldn't have to fight my insurance company alone. Instead, I:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracked every missing document.</li>
      <li>Cleaned up hazardous messes.</li>
      <li>Chased down receipts and reimbursements.</li>
      <li>Contacted my insurance adjuster directly (even though I wasn‚Äôt supposed to).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I <strong>became the adjuster</strong> PAM was supposed to be.</p>

    <h3>üìâ Missed Deadlines. Lost Money. No Accountability.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They <strong>missed key appointments</strong>, allowed vendors to walk off jobs, and didn‚Äôt show up to defend my claim.</li>
      <li>They waited <strong>2.5 weeks</strong> to act on my request to break my $6,250/month rental lease‚Äîcosting me $3,000.</li>
      <li>My credit cards maxed out. A lien was placed on my home. <strong>PAM still refused to provide my claim file</strong> unless subpoenaed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When I pushed harder?</p>
    <blockquote><em>A PAM representative literally told me to ‚Äúgo f*** myself.‚Äù Yes, you read that correctly.</em></blockquote>

    <h3>üîç What I‚Äôve Learned</h3>
    <p>PAM <strong>did not act in my best interest</strong>. They:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignored urgent requests and questions.</li>
      <li>Made critical mistakes in documentation.</li>
      <li>Gave false promises about coverage and deadlines.</li>
      <li>Refused to cooperate with my attorney.</li>
      <li><strong>Mishandled funds</strong>‚Äîover $24,000 in ALE payments remain unaccounted for.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This wasn‚Äôt a one-time mistake. This was a <strong>pattern of indifference, incompetence, and mismanagement</strong>.</p>

    <h3>‚ùó My Warning to You</h3>
    <p>If you're thinking of hiring <strong>Public Adjusters of Michigan (PAM)</strong>:</p>
    <p><strong style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #a94442;">DON‚ÄôT.</strong></p>

    <p>This site is my <strong>public warning</strong>, because no one should have to go through what I did. You can read the full month-by-month breakdown on the <a href="#">timeline</a> or hear the whole story below.</p>

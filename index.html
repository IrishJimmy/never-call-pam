  <h2>Never Trust PAM!  Here is my True Story</h2>
  <!-- (Table remains unchanged) -->

  <div class="blog-post">
    <h1>📢 "Trust the Process?"</h1>
	<h1> — How PAM Failed Me at Every Step</h1>
    
    <p>When a pipe burst in my ceiling in January 2024 and flooded my home, I thought the worst was over. I was wrong.</p>

    <p>That disaster marked the start of a <strong>year-and-a-half nightmare</strong>—not because of the water damage, but because of the company I hired to help me recover: <strong>Public Adjusters of Michigan (PAM)</strong>.</p>

    <p>They promised to be my advocates. Instead, they <strong>delayed, miscommunicated, dodged responsibility, and nearly bankrupted me</strong> while I fought to get my home—and my life—back.</p>

    <h3>🚨 Red Flags from the Start</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PAM failed to act quickly</strong> after the flood, allowing moisture to linger and damage to spread.</li>
      <li>Their "mitigation" was a joke—insulation was left hanging, soaked drywall ignored, and they brushed off my concerns.</li>
      <li>I asked questions. I pushed for updates. But PAM gave me <strong>radio silence for weeks</strong>—and eventually months.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>🧾 Doing Their Job <em>For</em> Them</h3>
    <p>I paid PAM <strong>10% of my entire claim</strong> so I wouldn't have to fight my insurance company alone. Instead, I:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tracked every missing document.</li>
      <li>Cleaned up hazardous messes.</li>
      <li>Chased down receipts and reimbursements.</li>
      <li>Contacted my insurance adjuster directly (even though I wasn’t supposed to).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I <strong>became the adjuster</strong> PAM was supposed to be.</p>

    <h3>📉 Missed Deadlines. Lost Money. No Accountability.</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>They <strong>missed key appointments</strong>, allowed vendors to walk off jobs, and didn’t show up to defend my claim.</li>
      <li>They waited <strong>2.5 weeks</strong> to act on my request to break my $6,250/month rental lease—costing me $3,000.</li>
      <li>My credit cards maxed out. A lien was placed on my home. <strong>PAM still refused to provide my claim file</strong> unless subpoenaed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When I pushed harder?</p>
    <h1><blockquote><em>A PAM representative told me to “Go Fuck Yourself!”</h1> Yes, you read that correctly.</em></blockquote>

    <h3>🔍 What I’ve Learned</h3>
    <p>PAM <strong>did not act in my best interest</strong>. They:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignored urgent over 100 phone calls and text requesting answers.</li>
      <li>Made critical mistakes in documentation and submiossions.</li>
      <li>Gave false promises about coverage and deadlines.</li>
      <li>Did not provide a copy of our case file, and Refused to cooperate with my attorney.</li>
      <li><strong>Mishandled funds</strong>—over $24,000 in ALE and other payments remain unaccounted for.</li>
    </ul>     <p>This wasn’t a one-time mistake. This was a <strong>pattern of indifference, incompetence, and mismanagement</strong>.</p>

    <h3>❗ My Warning to You</h3>
    <p>If you're thinking of hiring <strong>Public Adjusters of Michigan (PAM)</strong>:<strong style="font-size: 1.3em; color: #a94442;"> DON’T.</strong></p>
